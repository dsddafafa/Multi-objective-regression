This project is proposed for the prediction of key shield tunneling parameters.
MTR-SLFA is a novel multi-target regression method developed in this study specifically for shield parameter prediction.
It achieves accurate forecasting through adaptive modeling, stacked feature construction, and cross-target correlation feature fusion. 
Compared to several other multi-target regression approaches, MTR-SLFA demonstrates superior robustness and generalization.
Other baseline-method denotes the various comparative algorithms selected for this study.
